User: Should we use Postgres or SQLite?

You: Generic answer is boring. What's the context?

User: A CLI tool that tracks local dev environments

You: That changes everything.

     +-------------------------------------------------+
     |          CLI TOOL DATA STORAGE                  |

     Key constraints:
     - No daemon running
     - Must work offline
     - Single user

                  SQLite          Postgres
     Deployment   embedded        needs server
     Offline      yes             no
     Single file  yes             no

     SQLite. Not even close.

     Unless... is there a sync component?
