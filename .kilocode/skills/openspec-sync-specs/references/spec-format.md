# Spec formats

## Delta spec format

```markdown
## Purpose

Only on a delta that introduces a brand-new capability. Seeds the new main spec.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: New Feature
The system SHALL do something new.

#### Scenario: Basic case
- **WHEN** user does X
- **THEN** system does Y

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Existing Feature
The system SHALL keep doing the existing thing, now also handling A.

#### Scenario: Scenario the main spec already has
- **WHEN** user does X
- **THEN** system does Y

#### Scenario: New scenario to add
- **WHEN** user does A
- **THEN** system does B

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Deprecated Feature

## RENAMED Requirements

- FROM: `### Requirement: Old Name`
- TO: `### Requirement: New Name`
```

## Main spec format

Main specs are what a delta merges INTO. They must **never** contain delta operation headers (`## ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED Requirements`) — after syncing, every requirement lives under a single `## Requirements` section.

```markdown

## Requirements
